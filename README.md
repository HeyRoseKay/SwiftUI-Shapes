# Shapes

Commonly used shapes for SwiftUI, some I found on the web ([swiftui-lab](https://swiftui-lab.com)) others I made myself. 
I hope to create community based repo for cool animated shapes, paths, etc. If you would like to submit some of your own shapes just make a pull request and I will try to approve it ASAP. 

If you have an idea for a shape but don't know how to describe it, try out the `PathEditor` tool that comes packaged with [bez](https://github.com/kieranb662/bez)
